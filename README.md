# DiTRain
A sports trianing program

This is a meta repository for the program itself and it's development utililties. If you are interested in the program itself you can visit correponding sub-repository called "DiTRain" ([DiTRain](https://github.com/CMDR-DiTRay/DiTRain/tree/main/DiTRain)).

There is also an extra utility which allows to check your custom configuration files. To find more info check "plist_test" subrepository ([plist_test](<https://github.com/CMDR-DiTRay/DiTRain/tree/main/plist_test>)).

The project is in pre-alpha state now, but the plist_test utility already works.
